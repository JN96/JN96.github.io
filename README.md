James Nicholson Digital Résumé

This is a short digital version of my résumé which also serves as an outlet for me to tinker with some frontend wizadry. So far it includes the following sections:

    About
    Education
    Experience
    Skills
    Projects

From time-to-time I may decide to redesign the site using different technologies and libraries to keep it fresh and as a way to discover and learn new technologies. This will always be a work in progress.

The below image is an up to date snapshot of what the résumé looks like when rendered, should it no longer be publicly accessible online.
