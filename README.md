James Nicholson Digital Résumé

This is a short digital version of my résumé which also serves as an outlet for me to tinker with some frontend wizadry. So far it includes the following sections:

    About
    Education
    Experience
    Skills
    Projects

Always a Work in Progress

I believe this side project is at a point where it is acceptable for an end user to view it. However, it will always be a work in progress. I will continue to update it and perform bug fixes should they arise.

From time-to-time I may decide to redesign the site using different technologies and libraries to keep it fresh and as a way to discover and learn new technologies.
